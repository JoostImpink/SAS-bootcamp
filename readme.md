# SAS Bootcamp

In this repository you can find some tutorials to get familiar to using WRDS and SAS.

WRDS is a data warehouse that has commonly used datasets (Compustat, CRSP, IBES, Audit Analytics, etc), that you can access remotely (and programatically) using SAS' remote submit.

The tutorials help you get familiar with SAS (local install or SAS Studio hosted on WRDS), some main procedures, and accessing datasets on WRDS.
